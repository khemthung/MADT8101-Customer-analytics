## Data collected and features
- both online banking and offline counter services from all touchpoints
- Aim to get most of the transaction and behavioural action data from our customer

- the process is to gather all the data from each product and services to create customer single view

## Customer Single View (mock up)

- key here is having user identifier to map user across platform and create the Customer profile for our business
- also need to make sure we get all the feature needed for **indicator setup** and lead to decision making later on

## Use Cases
1) Next best offer (Cross-sells with product by user life stage) eg. some life event speding for bank to help (Buying house, New car, Getting married, planning for kids, etc.)
2) Lead scoring (Segment to identify customer) - seting score for each BU can identify user and action to imprece services
3) Upsell/Top-up (view spending transaction and apply with more interesting offers)
4) Customer retention (maintain existing customer & churn prediction)
